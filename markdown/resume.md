Work Experience
----------

**Senior Sofware Developer 2015-present, YOOX NET A PORTER GROUP:**

Evolving the company *order management system* platform implementing new strategic features while ensuring no business drawbacks for multiple brands with different business models.\

I started in 2015 as **software developer** taking part in the new order management system implementation to:

+ replace the legacy platform

+ integrate with *warehouses*, *accounting*, *payment*, *fraud* and *customer care* systems

+ integrate with *IBM Websphere Watson Commerce*

+ develop *omnichannel capabilities* (ship from store, split shipment, direct invoice, and so on)

+ develop the new strategic *order history* solution

I used to work since the beginning in the team responsible for the order lifecycle management, actively contributing to:

* the implementation of new features in the order system

* the integration with external domain systems developing several anti-corruption-layers

In 2019 I was promoted to **senior software developer** which meant leading the team from a technical point of view.

Communities
----------------------------------------

I am the founder and the coordinator of a local community named [*Functional Programming in Bologna*](https://fpinbo.dev/)

Every month I organize and run training workshops on Scala and Functional
Programming to help improve the skillset and knowledge of my team members.

Thanks to this community I had the opportunity to join the members of the [*Scala Italy*](http://2019.scala-italy.it/) in the organization of the 2019 edition in Bologna.

I am also an active member and co-founder of an Italian community named [*Functional Fest*](https://www.functionalfest.it/).
We are focused on the organization of an international conference about functional programming shortly.
