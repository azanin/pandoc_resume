Technical Experience
----------

Functional Programming
:   I’m constantly trying to learn new principles and techniques
surrounding Functional Programming and the technologies I have the most experience with are: **Scalaz**, **Cats**, **Cats-effect**, **Doobie**, **Http4s**, **Fs2**, **Shapeless**, **Monocle**.

Messaging Systems
:    In developing microservices I had experience interacting with message brokers of two different technologies, **RabbitMQ** and **IBM MQ**

Cloud Providers
:    Basic experience with **AWS**

Container technologies
:    I have developed Scala applications built and deployed in **Docker** containers.\ I use Docker it for **Integration Test** as well inside our continuous integration flow.

Continuous Integration and Deploy
:    I'm familiar with the definition of Continous Integrations pipelines using tools such as **Team City** and **Jenkins**. Lately, I have used **Travis** for some open source project.\
From a deploy perspective, I have worked in the definition of deploy pipeline using a tool like **Urban Code Deploy**

Open Source
:   I have contributed to some project:

    * Scalaz [link](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/1885)
    * jms4s [link](https://github.com/fp-in-bo/jms4s)
    * fs2-rabbit [link](https://github.com/profunktor/fs2-rabbit/releases/tag/2.1.0)

Programming Languages
:   **Scala:** This is my main programming language, I’ve been using it in production since 2015 and
have implemented functional principles as often as possible.

:   **Java:** I use Java daily so I'm comfortable with it.

:   Basic knowledge of **Haskell**, **C#**, **Kotlin**


Local Community
----------------------------------------

I am the founder and the coordinator of a local community named **Functional Programming in Bologna**. [link](https://fpinbo.dev/)\

Every month (more or less) I organise and run training workshops on Scala and Functional
Programming to help improve the skillset and knowledge of my team members.\

Thanks to this community I had the opportunity to join the members of the **Scala Italy** in the organization of the 2019 edition in Bologna. [link](http://2019.scala-italy.it/)

Apart from programming, I like to take care of plants and reading philosophy authors.\

Cats lover and owner!
