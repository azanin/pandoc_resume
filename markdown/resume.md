Experience
----------

**Senior Sofware Developer 2019-present, YOOX NET A PORTER GROUP:**

In 2019 I became a **Senior Software Developer** leading the team specialized in the management of the customer order lifecycle of our backend. Being the technical leader of the team focused me on further aspects like:

* Integrating and onboarding external clients on our platform
* Increase and manage the technical level of my team
* Be responsible for the architectural choices of our domain cooperating with other teams
* Have a strict connection with a business analyst for designing the best solution given the requirements
* Be the responsible for the technical judgment of new candidates that want to join our team

**Sofware Developer 2015-2019, YOOX NET A PORTER GROUP:**

I started as a **Software developer** in the team specialized in the management of the customer order lifecycle of our backend system.
During the very first period, we were very committed to building a brand new platform and so my effort has been focused mostly in:

* Develop a consistent number of microservices and anti-corruption layers
* Customize and manage a third-party order management system (IBM Sterling Order Management System)

**Internship trainee April-October 2015, YOOX NET A PORTER GROUP.**

I have been part of YOOX-NET-A-PORTER Graduate program
The trainee was about covering three different roles:

* Business Analyst
* Quality Assurance
* Software developer

Technical Experience
----------

Functional Programming
:   I spent a lot of time in learning principles and techniques of functional programming.
    During this years I worked mostly in **Scala** and I have applied this paradyghm exploiting
    libraries such as:

    * **scalaz**
    * **cats**
    * **cats-effect**
    * **doobie**
    * **http4s**
    * **fs2**
    * **shapeless**
    * **monocle**

    Nowadays I'm comfortable with the typelevel organization libraries and they are always present
    in our production applications.

Messaging Systems
:    In developing microservices I had experience interacting with message brokers of two different technologies:

    * **RabbitMQ**
    * **IBM MQ**

Cloud Providers
:    Basic experience with **AWS**

Container technologies
:    I have developed Scala applications built and deployed in **Docker** containers.\ I use Docker it for **Integration Test** as well inside our continuous integration flow.

Continuous Integration and Deploy
:    I'm familiar with the definition of Continous Integrations pipelines using tools such as **Team City** and **Jenkins**. Lately, I have used **Travis** for some open source project.\
From a deploy perspective, I have worked in the definition of deploy pipeline using a tool like **Urban Code Deploy**

Open Source
:   I have contributed to some project:

    * Scalaz [link](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/1885)
    * jms4s [link](https://github.com/fp-in-bo/jms4s)
    * fs2-rabbit [link](https://github.com/profunktor/fs2-rabbit/releases/tag/2.1.0)

Programming Languages
:   **Scala:** This the language I have more experience with.
    I started programming Scala in 2015 embracing functional programming as much as I can.

:   **Java:** I use Java daily so I'm comfortable with it.

:   Basic knowledge of **Haskell**, **C#**, **Kotlin**


Local Community
----------------------------------------

I am the founder and the coordinator of a local community named **Functional Programming in Bologna**. [link](https://fpinbo.dev/)\

I care about **spreading the knowledge about functional programming** and so I organize sessions every month (more or less).\

Thanks to this community I had the opportunity to join the members of the **Scala Italy** in the organization of the 2019 edition in Bologna. [link](http://2019.scala-italy.it/)

Certificates
----------------------------------------

* First Certificate in English C1

Hobbies
----------------------------------------

Apart from programming, I like to take care of plants and reading philosophy authors.\

Cats lover and owner!
